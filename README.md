    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up Telegram Bot Token & Channel ID:**
    * Create a new bot via Telegram's @BotFather and get your `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`.
    * Create a Telegram channel and add your bot as an administrator. Get your `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` (e.g., `@YourChannelUsername` or numeric ID).
    * For **local development**, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your credentials:
        ```
        TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
        TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID="@YOUR_CHANNEL_USERNAME_OR_ID_HERE"
        ```
        (Note: For production/GitHub Actions, these are handled via GitHub Secrets.)

5.  **Run the Bot (Local Testing):**
    ```bash
    python src/main.py
    ```
    The bot will run, collect news, and send it to your configured Telegram channel. A `sent_links.db` file will be created locally to track sent links.
